This can clutter the current window with multiple small panes. The preferred behavior is to open files in a new tmux **window** instead, providing a full-screen editing experience.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nThe `os.open`, `os.edit`, and `os.editAtLine` commands in `config/lazygit/config.yml` use:\n```bash\ntmux split-window -v \"nvim '{{filename}}'\"\n```\n\nThis creates a vertical split pane within the current tmux window.\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nChange the commands to use:\n```bash\ntmux new-window \"nvim '{{filename}}'\"\n```\n\nThis creates a new tmux window for the editor, leaving lazygit in its own full-screen pane.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `os.open` command opens nvim in a new tmux window (when no existing nvim pane found)\n- [ ] `os.edit` command opens nvim in a new tmux window (when no existing nvim pane found)\n- [ ] `os.editAtLine` command opens nvim in a new tmux window (when no existing nvim pane found)\n- [ ] Existing behavior preserved: if nvim is already open in a pane, reuse it\n- [ ] Verify behavior works correctly in tmux sessions\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nIn `config/lazygit/config.yml`, update lines 22, 30, and 38:\n\n**Before:**\n```yaml\ntmux split-window -v \"nvim '{{filename}}'\"\n```\n\n**After:**\n```yaml\ntmux new-window \"nvim '{{filename}}'\"\n```\n\nThe `-v` flag (vertical split) is no longer needed since `new-window` creates a full window.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `config/lazygit/config.yml` (lines 22, 30, 38)","created_at":"2026-01-08T04:12:22Z"}]}

{"id":"df-pod","title":"Add global Claude skills for beads-plan (PM planning) and beads-build (autonomous implementation)","description":"Create two new global Claude Code skills that work together for a planning-then-execution workflow using beads issues.\n\n## Background\n\nThe dotfiles already has global Claude skills in `config/claude/commands/`:\n- `setup-permissions.md` - Sets up project-specific Claude permissions\n- `work-bead.md` - Finds and works on ready bead issues autonomously\n\nThis feature adds two complementary skills that split the PM/developer workflow:\n\n1. **beads-plan** - Acts as a PM to flesh out issues with acceptance criteria, implementation notes, and proper structure before development begins\n2. **beads-build** - Acts as a developer to autonomously implement issues that have been properly planned\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### beads-plan skill\n- [ ] Creates `config/claude/commands/beads-plan.md` \n- [ ] Skill takes an issue ID as argument (e.g., `/beads-plan df-123`)\n- [ ] Reads the issue using `bd show \u003cid\u003e`\n- [ ] Analyzes the issue and fleshes it out with:\n  - Clear, actionable acceptance criteria (checkbox format)\n  - Implementation notes with suggested approach\n  - Updated title if the current one is vague\n  - Identified dependencies (creates them with `bd dep add` if needed)\n  - Estimated complexity/scope notes\n- [ ] Updates the issue description using `bd update \u003cid\u003e --description=\"...\"`\n- [ ] Does NOT implement - only plans and documents\n- [ ] Reports summary of changes made to the issue\n\n### beads-build skill\n- [ ] Creates `config/claude/commands/beads-build.md`\n- [ ] Skill takes an issue ID as argument (e.g., `/beads-build df-123`)\n- [ ] Validates the issue has acceptance criteria before starting\n- [ ] Claims the issue with `bd update \u003cid\u003e --claim`\n- [ ] Implements the solution following the acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Checks off acceptance criteria as they are completed\n- [ ] Runs verification (tests, build, lint as applicable)\n- [ ] Closes the issue with `bd close \u003cid\u003e --reason=\"...\"`\n- [ ] Reports what was done\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### File locations\nBoth skills go in `config/claude/commands/` following the existing pattern:\n- Frontmatter with `description` field\n- Markdown body with workflow steps\n\n### Skill structure pattern\nFollow the `work-bead.md` pattern:\n1. Clear step-by-step workflow\n2. Specific bash commands to run\n3. Guidelines section at the end\n4. Autonomous execution instructions where appropriate\n\n### Relationship between skills\n- `beads-plan` should be run first to prepare an issue\n- `beads-build` expects a well-structured issue with acceptance criteria\n- `beads-build` should warn/fail gracefully if acceptance criteria are missing\n\n### Integration with existing skills\n- `work-bead.md` could optionally be updated to prefer issues that have acceptance criteria\n- Consider if `beads-plan` should be invoked automatically as part of `work-bead` flow\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Automatic triggering between plan and build\n- GitHub/Linear integration\n- Multi-issue batch processing","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"jeremy.saenz","created_at":"2026-01-07T20:02:11.734735-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T20:12:17.588472-08:00"}
