The new paradigm:\n- **Plan** phase: Flesh out issue requirements (PM work)\n- **Build** phase: Implement the planned work (Dev work)\n- **Navigate**: Jump to existing tmux window for a bead\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### P - Plan (replaces D)\n- [ ] Pressing `P` on a bead creates a tmux window named after the bead ID\n- [ ] Window runs Claude with the `/codegangsta:plan` skill for that bead\n- [ ] Window opens in background (user stays in lazybeads)\n- [ ] If window already exists, should navigate to it (or warn user)\n\n### B - Build (replaces W)\n- [ ] Pressing `B` on a bead creates a tmux window named after the bead ID\n- [ ] Window runs Claude with the `/codegangsta:build` skill for that bead\n- [ ] Window opens in background (user stays in lazybeads)\n- [ ] If window already exists, should navigate to it (or warn user)\n\n### G - Go to Window\n- [ ] Pressing `G` navigates to the tmux window for the selected bead\n- [ ] If no window exists for that bead, show a message or create one\n- [ ] Should work regardless of which context (list or detail view)\n\n### General\n- [ ] Old shortcuts (D, W) should be removed or remapped to avoid confusion\n- [ ] Keep C, R, E shortcuts as they serve different purposes\n- [ ] All new windows should use `-d` flag to open in background\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Tmux Window Naming\n- Use the bead ID as the window name: `-n '{{.ID}}'`\n- This allows `G` to find the window with `tmux select-window -t '{{.ID}}'`\n\n### Skills to Use\n- Plan: `/codegangsta:plan {{.ID}}`\n- Build: `/codegangsta:build {{.ID}}`\n\n### Window Existence Check\nFor `G` and potentially `P`/`B`, check if window exists:\n```bash\nif tmux list-windows -F '#{window_name}' | grep -q '^{{.ID}}$'; then\n  tmux select-window -t '{{.ID}}'\nelse\n  # create or show message\nfi\n```\n\n### Context\n- `P` and `B` should work in `list` context (selecting from issue list)\n- `G` should work in both `list` and `detail` contexts\n\n## Questions to Resolve\n- Should `P`/`B` reuse existing window if one exists, or always create new?\n- What should `G` do if no window exists - create one or show error?\n- Should we remove `D` and `W` entirely or keep them as aliases?\n\n## Related\n- Recent commits: 9b0de42, 89370fc show evolution of tmux window approach\n- Skills: `/codegangsta:plan` and `/codegangsta:build` already exist","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"jeremy.saenz","created_at":"2026-01-08T09:43:39.08587-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-08T09:45:34.753806-08:00"}
