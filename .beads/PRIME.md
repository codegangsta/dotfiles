# Beads Workflow Context

> **Context Recovery**: Run `bd prime` after compaction, clear, or new session
> Hooks auto-call this in Claude Code when .beads/ detected

# HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED - DO NOT CLOSE ISSUES

**CRITICAL**: You are NOT authorized to close issues. When your work is complete:

1. Add a summary comment: `bd comments add <id> "Implementation complete. Ready for review: <summary>"`
2. Mark as blocked: `bd update <id> --status=blocked`
3. Report that the issue is awaiting human review

The human owner will review your work and close the issue manually. **NEVER use `bd close`.**

# SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: Before saying "done" or "complete", you MUST run this checklist:

```
[ ] 1. git status              (check what changed)
[ ] 2. git add <files>         (stage code changes)
[ ] 3. bd sync                 (commit beads changes)
[ ] 4. git commit -m "..."     (commit code)
[ ] 5. bd sync                 (commit any new beads changes)
[ ] 6. git push                (push to remote)
```

**NEVER skip this.** Work is not done until pushed.

## Core Rules
- Track strategic work in beads (multi-session, dependencies, discovered work)
- Use `bd create` for issues, TodoWrite for simple single-session execution
- When in doubt, prefer bd—persistence you don't need beats lost context
- Git workflow: hooks auto-sync, run `bd sync` at session end
- Session management: check `bd ready` for available work

## Essential Commands

### Finding Work
- `bd ready` - Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
- `bd list --status=open` - All open issues
- `bd list --status=in_progress` - Your active work
- `bd show <id>` - Detailed issue view with dependencies

### Creating & Updating
- `bd create --title="..." --type=task|bug|feature --priority=2` - New issue
  - Priority: 0-4 or P0-P4 (0=critical, 2=medium, 4=backlog). NOT "high"/"medium"/"low"
- `bd update <id> --status=in_progress` - Claim work
- `bd update <id> --status=blocked` - Mark for human review when work is complete
- `bd update <id> --assignee=username` - Assign to someone
- `bd comments add <id> "message"` - Add a comment (use for implementation summaries)
- **Tip**: When creating multiple issues/tasks/epics, use parallel subagents for efficiency

### Dependencies & Blocking
- `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` - Add dependency (issue depends on depends-on)
- `bd blocked` - Show all blocked issues
- `bd show <id>` - See what's blocking/blocked by this issue

### Sync & Collaboration
- `bd sync` - Sync with git remote (run at session end)
- `bd sync --status` - Check sync status without syncing

### Project Health
- `bd stats` - Project statistics (open/closed/blocked counts)
- `bd doctor` - Check for issues (sync problems, missing hooks)

## Common Workflows

**Starting work:**
```bash
bd ready           # Find available work
bd show <id>       # Review issue details
bd update <id> --status=in_progress  # Claim it
```

**Completing work (for human review):**
```bash
bd comments add <id> "Implementation complete. Ready for review:
- <summary of changes>
- <files modified>
- <tests status>"
bd update <id> --status=blocked    # Mark for human review
bd sync                            # Push to remote
```

**Creating dependent work:**
```bash
# Run bd create commands in parallel (use subagents for many items)
bd create --title="Implement feature X" --type=feature
bd create --title="Write tests for X" --type=task
bd dep add beads-yyy beads-xxx  # Tests depend on Feature (Feature blocks tests)
```
