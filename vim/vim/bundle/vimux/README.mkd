# vimux

Easily interact with tmux from vim.

What inspired me to write vimux was [tslime.vim](https://github.com/kikijump/tslime.vim), a plugin that lets you send input to tmux. While tslime.vim works well, I felt it wasn't optimized for my primary use case which was having a smaller tmux pane that I would use to run tests or play with a REPL.

My goal with vimux is to make interacting with tmux from vim effortless. By default when you call `VimuxRunCommand` vimux will create a 20% tall horizontal pane under your current tmux pane and execute a command in it without losing focus of vim. Once that pane exists whenever you call `VimuxRunCommand` again the command will be executed in that pane. As I was using vimux myself I wanted to rerun commands over and over. An example of this was running the current file through rspec. Rather than typing that over and over I wrote `VimuxRunLastCommand` that will execute the last command you called with `VimuxRunCommand`.

Other auxiliary functions and the ones I talked about above can be found bellow with a full description and example key binds for your vimrc.

## Installation

With **[vim-bundle](https://github.com/benmills/vim-bundle)**: `vim-bundle install benmills/vimux`

Otherwise download the latest [tarball](https://github.com/benmills/vimux/tarball/master), extract it and move `plugin/vimux.vim` inside `~/.vim/plugin`. If you're using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), then move the entire folder extracted from the tarball into `~/.vim/bundle`.

_Notes:_ 

* Vimux assumes a tmux version >= 1.5. Some older versions might work but it is recommeded to use at least version 1.5.
